My test project.
Just a feedback engine(not finished).
Using Refinery CMS.

Administration page http://localhost:3000/refinery

login: login
password: login

Changes:
0.1)fixed feedback&settings routes,radio_button_tag changed to radio_button(work more correctly)
0.2)added recaptcha to user form. But it doesn't work correctly ("The data you entered for the CAPTCHA wasn't correct" all time).
